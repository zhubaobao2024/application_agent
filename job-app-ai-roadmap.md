## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| **Job scraping blocks** | High | Use multiple sources, implement rate limiting, rotate user agents, have API fallbacks |
| **AI API costs** | Medium | Set usage limits per user, optimize prompts for token efficiency, cache common generations |
| **Data privacy concerns** | Critical | Implement GDPR compliance from day 1, encrypt sensitive data, clear privacy policy |
| **Scaling issues** | Medium | Use cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling, implement caching, optimize database queries |
| **API rate limits (OpenAI/LinkedIn)** | High | Implement exponential backoff, queue system, fallback providers |
| **Poor AI output quality** | High | Extensive prompt engineering, user feedback loop, A/B testing different prompts |

> **Tip:** Refer to DESIGN.md "Risks & Mitigation" section for more details.
